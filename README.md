Data Mining Analysis of the Zoo Dataset: Unveiling Patterns and Predictive Models
Data mining techniques have proven to be valuable in extracting knowledge and patterns from large and complex datasets. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the Zoo dataset using various data mining techniques. The Zoo dataset comprises animal attributes, including physical characteristics and behavioral traits, along with corresponding animal types. Our study aims to uncover hidden patterns within the dataset, classify animals into distinct types, and build predictive models for animal classification.
